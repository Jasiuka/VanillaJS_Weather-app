# Vanilla JavaScript "Weather app" web application

## 2nd project of vanilla JavaScript

Decided to make some simple projects by myself, but everytime with different technology, this way I will renew my knowledge of technology or learn something new, so I thought it would be a good practice.

There will be 2 simple projects:

1. "Todo list" web application
2. Weather web application

"Todo list" project features:

- Pages (delete page, add new, move through pages) max pages - 7 (for every week day)
- Saving data to local storage of the browser
- Editing todo
- Deleting todo
- Editing page title
- Adding new todo when "Enter" key is pressed

Weather application project features:

- Changing units and hours format
- User can save data to local storage
- Saved data is loaded whenever user enters web page
- Background image depending on weather
-

In what technologies I will build these web apps:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- React.js
- React.js with TypeScript
- Svelte\*
- Vue.js

## This is the second project, "Weather app" web application with vanilla JavaScript
